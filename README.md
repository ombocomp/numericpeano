numericpeano
============

Peano numbers with the expected bells and whistles. The implementation is naive (the memory footprint of a number n is O(n) bytes).

Features:
* lazy evaluation, i.e. compatibility with infinity,
* positive as well as negative numbers (N and Z),
* instances for the usual typeclasses: Enum, Bounded, Num, Integral, etc.
